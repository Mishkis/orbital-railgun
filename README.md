## Description

If you've ever wanted to destroy large swathes of land in an instant while having no regard for the local fauna and wildlife present, then our new invention of the Orbital Railgun may interest you. By harnessing the power of a star, you are able to communicate directly to our rapid-response railgun satalite, allowing for quick and easy access to absolute destruction. Simply aim your Orbital Railgun and fire, and within half a minute you will have caused an ecological disaster, but at least the area is clear now!

*Note: it **WILL** destroy bedrock.*

## Usage

![Crafting Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/591ad1cff565f3726f685eacf8416eda0a18ff3a.png)

Once you've crafted the Orbital Railgun, hold `right click` to aim and then `left click` to fire.

*Note: This mod uses the Satin API for shaders, yet you shouldn't have to install it as it's included as a jar-in-jar dependency.*
